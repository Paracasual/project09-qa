# Urban Scooter

## Project Summary:
Urban Scooters offers an innovative rental service through two platforms: a web application designed for customers to rent scooters with ease and an Android mobile app tailored for couriers to manage and fulfill delivery requests effectively.

To deliver a high-quality and reliable user experience, the Urban Scooters application suite underwent thorough testing, encompassing various areas such as manual quality assurance (QA), API testing, mobile testing, and database validation. Chrome DevTools played a key role in identifying and resolving issues within the web application, ensuring smooth performance and optimization.

A comprehensive suite of tools supported the testing process. JIRA was used for tracking bugs and managing project workflows, enabling efficient resolution of issues. Google Workspace facilitated collaboration among team members, streamlining communication and documentation. Postman was instrumental in verifying and validating APIs, while Android Studio was utilized to test and debug the mobile application. Additionally, Miro was invaluable for creating test plans, visualizing workflows, and organizing the overall testing strategy for both applications.

## Responsibilities and Contributions:
As a QA engineer, my role involved the following:

- Conducted extensive cross-browser manual testing for the web application, focusing on critical user flows such as scooter rentals and order tracking. Ensured data input validation and compliance with design requirements.
- Developed comprehensive test artifacts, including test cases, reports, and documentation, to enhance the overall testing process.
- Performed in-depth mobile testing for the courier app to identify and address functional performance issues.
- Verified backend API functionality using Postman, carefully analyzing outputs through database queries.
- Ensured database accuracy by executing SQL queries to confirm correct data handling and retrieval.

## Testing Methodologies:
The testing process relied heavily on functional system testing for the web application, with test cases designed using black-box testing techniques. These techniques included equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, ensuring both positive and negative scenarios were covered.

For API testing, the focus was on maintaining data integrity and confirming that the structure and format adhered to expected standards. Black-box testing principles were applied to validate data accuracy and reliability.

Mobile testing centered on evaluating the app's functionality and stability. By leveraging Android Studio, including its built-in emulator, I was able to test APKs, analyze logs, and ensure consistent app performance across different environments.
